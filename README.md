# Water level

There is a div with <code>id=bottle-container</code> having width of 300px, representing the max limit.
Since max limit is 10, and width is 300px, meaning one level is 30px.

The div with <code>id="water-level"</code>, startis with width="0px" but upon each click on button 
with id="add-water", it increments level by one and width increases by 30px.

Note:- After 10 clicks when width of <code>#water-level</code> div is 300px, any further clicks should not increase width
